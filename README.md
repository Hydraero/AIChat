# AIChat
This is a project using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 chatbot

This project was created using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Vite for the front end (client). Express and Node.js was used to create the backend and connect to the OpenAI GPT-3 API.

Run the program by using 'npm run server' in the server directory in addition to 'npm run dev' in the client directory.

Server will run on http://localhost:5000

Client will run on http://127.0.0.1:5173

Server URL will be required to change depending on the server deployment location.

This follows JavaScriptMastery's (on youtube) tutorial. Github here: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_openai_codex
